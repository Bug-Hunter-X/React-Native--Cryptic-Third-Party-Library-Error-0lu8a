# React Native Cryptic Third-Party Library Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging bug in React Native: cryptic errors when using third-party libraries. The problem often manifests as an undefined is not a function error or a similar vague message, making debugging difficult.  The root cause is frequently incorrect linking of native modules or missing native dependencies.

## Bug Reproduction

The `ThirdPartyBug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  Follow these steps to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages (`npm install`).
3. Observe the error when running the app.

## Solution

The `ThirdPartyBugSolution.js` file provides a working solution by correctly configuring the third-party library. This typically involves checking native module linking (especially on Android and iOS), verifying that all necessary dependencies are installed, and ensuring the correct library version is used.  Specific steps depend on the library; consult its documentation.
