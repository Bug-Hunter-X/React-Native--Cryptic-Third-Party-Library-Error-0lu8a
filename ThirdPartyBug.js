This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly configured or integrated into your React Native project. It's often related to issues with native modules, such as incorrect linking or missing dependencies. The error message might not be very specific, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  Example:
```javascript
import {MyThirdPartyLibrary} from 'my-third-party-library';

// ... later in your component
<MyThirdPartyLibrary/>
```
This might result in a cryptic error, possibly an undefined is not a function error related to MyThirdPartyLibrary.
