The solution involves meticulously checking the third-party library's documentation for setup instructions, specifically focusing on native module linking. This often includes using tools like `react-native link` (though it's becoming less reliable) or manually linking the native code for both iOS and Android.  Verify all native dependencies are correctly installed.  If using CocoaPods or Gradle, inspect the Podfile and build.gradle files for correctness. Example (Illustrative, adapt based on your library):

```javascript
// ThirdPartyBugSolution.js
import {MyThirdPartyLibrary} from 'my-third-party-library'; // Ensure correct import

// ... other imports and code
// ... properly check the installation and linking steps as described in the library's documentation.

//If it is a native module, ensure you have correctly linked the module 
//in both iOS and Android, by adding the necessary code to the respective files.
//Example for android:
//Add the following lines to your `android/app/build.gradle` file
// dependencies {
//     implementation project(':my-third-party-library')
//}

//For iOS make sure you have the correct pods in your `Podfile`
// pod 'MyThirdPartyLibrary',
//     :path => '../node_modules/my-third-party-library'

<MyThirdPartyLibrary/>
```
